### Project Description

### What case are we solving?
It is necessary to write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts

**Copmetition conditions:**
- The computer guesses an integer from 0 to 100, and we need to guess it. By "guess" is meant "write a program that will guess the number." 
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether a random number is greater or less than the one we need. 

**Quality metric**
The results are evaluated by the average number of attempts with 1000 repetitions

**What we practice**
- Learn to write good python code.
- Learn to work with IDE.
- Learn to work with GitHub.



## Brief information about the date
As data, we generate a numpy array of random integers from 1 to 100 inclusive.

**Stages of work on the project**
- Task evaluation
- Method release
- Evaluation of the result
- Registration of results in a notebook
- Design README.md

## Result:
The number of attempts was reduced to 6-7

## Conclusions:
The method of finding the number by the method of half division corresponds to the task and shows the result better than the threshold value of 20.
